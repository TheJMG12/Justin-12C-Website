	<p> As someone who is on technology on a daily basis for long amounts of 
	time, one of the most important things is to have a great computer. 
	Speciffically a laptop, in most cases a laptop is much better than PC with a tower and
	monitor. For many reasons such as the portability and mobility, but also 
	it can be more comfortbale to use a laptop than sitting at a deskt with a
	computer. Although some may say you can get a desktop with "better" specs 
	for a cheaper price, it all comes down to prefrence, just for the mobility
	alone a computer with high specs is worth. But the question is which ones
	are? </p>
