		<!-- Introduction -->
	<p> As someone who is on technology on a daily basis for long amounts of 
	time, one of the most important things is to have a great computer. 
	Speciffically a laptop, in most cases a laptop is much better than PC with a tower and
	monitor. For many reasons such as the portability and mobility, but also 
	it can be more comfortbale to use a laptop than sitting at a deskt with a
	computer. Although some may say you can get a desktop with "better" specs 
	for a cheaper price, it all comes down to prefrence, just for the mobility
	alone a computer with high specs is worth. But the question is which ones
	are? </p>
	<h2> What Makes a Great Laptop</h2>
	<p> When your always on a laptop and performing demanding activities, it
	is important to have a laptop that can handle that.</p>
	<p>The key features a great laptop should have include: </p> 
	 <ul>
    <li>A High-end Processor</li>
    <li>At least 15-inch Screen</li>
    <li>A lot of RAM Storage</li>
    <li>A lot of HDD Storage)</li>
    <li>A High-end Video Card</li>
  </ul>
	
	<p>It is necessary to have a good processor which is fast enough, the best
	processor is the Intel Core i7 6700HQ (2.60 GHz). This processor is in most
	high-end laptops now, it is 2.60 GHz (gigahertz) this a clock frequency or
	clock speed, whichrepresents a cylce time, the higher the GHz the faster 
	the laptop is. When having a high-end processor, it allows the laptop to 
	complete tasks quicker and it quickens start up times. </p>
	<p> Having a big enough sreen is important because it is the thing the user 
	is staring at for long amounts of hours. Having a bigger screen may be more
	beneficial for gaming, video or photo editing, or completing tasks. </p>
	<p> Having a enough random-access memory is a significant key to a great 
	computer. RAM stores frequently used program instructions to increase 
	the speed of a computer. So a sufficient amount of RAM for a demanding
	user is 16GB. </p>
	<p> As a demanding user a lot of storage would be necessary to store programs
	or files. For a gamer, most games are 5GB at the least for a light game, 
	while a bigger game will be at least 15 GB. A video editor or creator would
	also need a lot of storage to save all teh files creatd or used. So a good 
	amount of storage would be at least 500GB or 1TB. </p>
	<p> Having a great video card or graphics card is valuable to have, most 
	games need a good graphics card to run. A video card generates a feed of 
	output images to a screen. Although a laptop would have an internal card
	a NVIDIA GTX 970M would be a suitable card to have, whereas the most high-end 
	card is NVIDIA GTX 1080M. </p>
	<h2> What Makes a Demanding User</h2>
	<p> Before investing a fairly large amount of money into a laptop,
	it must be used frequently and the user must be a demanding one. A
	demanding user is someone who is on a computer for long periods of time
	or doing tasks which require high speeds and lots of running memory.</p>
	<p> A demanding user mainly uses a laptop for:</p>
	<ul>
    <li>Gaming</li>
    <li>Software Development</li>
    <li>Sound Engineering</li>
    <li>Video Editing</li>
    <li>Photo Editing</li>
  </ul>
